## Data storage
 To store system data and save the project, I chose sqlite in conjunction with the Hibernate framework.
 ### sqlite reasons:
  - after many tests, I decided that the NetBeans project system did not suit me
  - I wanted the project to be saved in one file with the extension I choose - other databases such as H2 or hsql did not allow it.
  - perhaps in the future the project file will be a spatialite extension
 ### Hibernate reasons:
  - great support
  - as the only JPA provider allowed for dynamic configuration of connection with the local database
  - the speed of the connection is not the decisive criterion
