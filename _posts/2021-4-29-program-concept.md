In principle, the program should look and work like other GIS programs (ArcView, QGIS).
 It will be built on the NetBeans platform, which means that it will be possible to run only one instance of the program, not like, for example, in QGIS - one project - one program window.  The solution to the problem will be the registration of several projects, the content of which can be viewed, working on one of them with the possibility of copying the content from other registered projects.
 Additionally, an empty project will be registered by default, the task of which will be a quick preview of layers or launching tools or a quick print.  This project can be exported and registered for further work.
